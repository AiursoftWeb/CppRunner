## Develop

in the root directory, run

```bash
npm i
npm run dev
```

Runs the app in the development mode.

Open http://localhost:5173/ to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.

You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Build

run command:

```bash
npm build
```

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
